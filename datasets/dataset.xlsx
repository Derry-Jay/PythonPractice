Infants and children must demonstrate the ability to maintain euglycemia during a fast of age-appropriate duration. The normal duration of fasting for an infant or child depends on body mass and the maturity of counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia, which include gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and ketogenesis."

Correction of the biochemical abnormality can reverse some symptoms, but central nervous system damage progresses regardless of treatment."	
							The PDC can provide an alternative pathway for pyruvate metabolism PDC activity can be optimized by cofactor supplementation with thiamine and lipoic acid and administration of dichloroacetate. Increased pyruvate metabolism through this pathway can help reduce the pyruvate and lactate levels.	
							Biotin supplementation is given to help optimize the residual enzyme activity but is usually of little use.	
							Citrate supplementation reduces the acidosis and provides the needed substrate in the citric acid cycle.

For types of GSD that involve the liver, treatment is aimed at keeping the right level of glucose in the blood. This is often enough to maintain the cells fuel needs and prevent long-term complications associated with poorly controlled GSD. Treatment consists of taking regular doses of uncooked cornstarch and/or nutrition supplements. Cornstarch is a complex carbohydrate that is difficult for the body to digest; therefore it maintains normal blood sugar levels for a longer period of time than most carbohydrates in food. Eating many small meals that are low in sugar can help keep blood sugar levels normal while preventing excess glycogen storage in the liver."
